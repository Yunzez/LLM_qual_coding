      "text": "SUT/target: The System Under Test (SUT) is the piece of software that is being tested. It can either be a standalone application like a command-line program or a library.\nFuzzing/Fuzzer: Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, is an automated software testing method that supplies a SUT with invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs. The program that implements the fuzzing algorithm is called a fuzzer.\nTest case: A test case is the concrete input that is given to the testing harness. Usually, it is a string or bitstring. A test input can also be encoded in a more complex format like an abstract syntax tree.\n(Testing/fuzzing) harness: A harness handles the test setup for a given SUT. The harness wraps the software and initializes it such that it is ready for executing test cases. A harness integrates a SUT into a testing environment.\nlibFuzzer harness: A harness that is compatible with the libFuzzer library. The term refers to the LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput function.\nFuzz test: A fuzz test consists of a fuzzing harness and the SUT. You might refer to a compiled binary that includes the harness and SUT as a fuzz test.\nFuzzing campaign: A fuzzing campaign is an execution of the fuzzer. A fuzzing campaign starts when the fuzzer starts testing and stops when the fuzzing procedure is stopped.\nCorpus: The evolving set of test cases. During a fuzzing campaign, the corpus usually grows as new test cases are discovered.\nSeed Corpus: Fuzzing campaigns are usually bootstrapped using an initial set of test cases. This set is also called a seed corpus. Each test case of the corpus is called a seed.\nFuzzing engine/runtime: The fuzzing engine/runtime is part of the fuzzer that is executed when the fuzzing starts. It orchestrates the fuzzing process.\nInstrumentation: The act of instrumenting a program involves adding non-functional changes in order to retrieve data from it or making it more secure/robust.\nCode coverage: A metric to measure the degree to which the source code of a program is executed.\n",

      "text": "the corporate VC arm of health insurer CSS, invests in high-growth start-ups that are advancing healthcare with digital technologies. It particularly promotes solutions that create sustainable added value for health insurers and their customers.\n\nThanks to the support of CSS, the SwissHealth Ventures digital health fund has now doubled its volume from CHF 50 million to CHF 100 million. The additional funds will enable around twelve further start-up investments in the coming years. SwissHealth Ventures operates with an evergreen structure, which means that the returns flow back into the fund and are available for further investments.\n\nSwissHealth Ventures plans to use the fresh funds to invest in two to three new digital health start-ups each year. It will invest jointly with other European venture capitalists with the aim of supporting the start-ups in their market entry in Switzerland through the health insurance company's expertise and network. \"We believe that the digital health sector will grow at an even faster pace in the coming years and is set to become even more attractive within the healthcare industry. Technological innovations, AI and the trend towards outpatient treatment are contributing significantly to this,\" explains Jonathan Fraser, Head of Corporate Venturing, SwissHealth Ventures. This represents a strategic opportunity for CSS: it gains early access to leading start-ups and innovative solutions that can be integrated into its offerings.\n\nSwissHealth Ventures has invested in twelve companies to date – four of them from Switzerland – and two digital health funds. The results are impressive: the twelve existing portfolio companies have created over 3,200 jobs and are financially successful. ‘More than 330,000 CSS members have already used one of their services, giving them access to innovations that improve their lives and make the healthcare system more sustainable,’ explains Fraser. One example is Flow Neuroscience from Sweden: CSS was the first health insurance company worldwide to reimburse Flow's new therapy for the treatment of depression, which is already being used in 16 Swiss clinics today.\n\nSwissHealth Ventures invests in digital business models in the healthcare sector in a growth phase with a monthly turnover of approximately CHF 100,000 or more. In addition to start-ups that offer effective benefits for CSS policyholders, companies that make the healthcare system more efficient are also eligible. A good example is Lyfegen from Basel. Jonathan Fraser says: ‘This platform helps us negotiate fair prices with pharmaceutical companies. This year alone, we have saved CHF 3.5 million as a result.’",

      "text": "[00:00:00] Let’s be honest: if you’ve been on the internet,\n[00:00:02] you’ve probably seen porn.\n[00:00:03] Whether you went looking for it,\n[00:00:05] a friend shoved a video under your nose,\n[00:00:06] or you got a sketchy DM,\n[00:00:08] it’s hard not to come across porn in our extremely online world.\n[00:00:12] Either way, your first encounter with porn might have piqued your curiosity.\n[00:00:15] Or it might have even disturbed you.\n[00:00:17] It’s okay—we’re gonna unpack all of that together.\n[00:00:20] Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed.\n[00:00:23] [THEME MUSIC]\n[00:00:27] Head’s up: in today’s video, we’ll be talking about a sensitive topic,\n[00:00:31] including sexual assault and descriptions of certain kinds of sex acts.\n[00:00:35] So please keep that in mind and take care when watching.\n[00:00:37] We learn about sex from a lot of different sources.\n[00:00:40] But nobody seems to want to admit that for a lot of people,\n[00:00:43] one of their biggest teachers is pornography:\n[00:00:45] videos, films, magazines, and other forms of media that are meant for sexual arousal.\n[00:00:50] No matter what popped into your head when I first said “porn,”\n[00:00:53] the word has a pretty broad definition,\n[00:00:55] because what’s considered arousing can really vary from person to person.\n[00:00:59] In a Supreme Court case about which sexual material was obscene enough to censor,\n[00:01:03] one of the justices said porn was hard to define,\n[00:01:06] but “I know it when I see it.”\n[00:01:09] Whatever it is, porn is a part of our society.\n[00:01:11] Like, one survey from 2022 found that seventy-three percent of\n[00:01:15] teenagers may have seen porn online,\n[00:01:17] many before the age of thirteen,\n[00:01:19] despite the rise of age-restriction laws that require viewers to be eighteen or older.\n[00:01:24] Teen Shan: Well I definitely don’t watch porn.\n[00:01:26] Shan: Girl, I’m you. I know you’re lying.\n[00:01:29] But I don’t blame you.\n[00:01:30] ‘Cause here’s the thing:\n[00:01:31] The way sex ed classes and the adults in our lives talk about porn\n[00:01:34] — if they do at all —\n[00:01:36] is often full of shame.\n[00:01:37] And that leaves people with a sense that they shouldn’t ask questions.\n[00:01:40] But it turns out, one of the best ways\n[00:01:42] to responsibly engage with porn… is by getting curious.\n[00:01:46] The first thing to know?\n[00:01:47] Images that we might consider pornographic today have been around forever.\n[00:01:50] Peruvian sex pots sculpted fifteen hundred years ago,\n[00:01:53] frescoes from 1st-century Pompeii,\n[00:01:56] 17th-century erotic Japanese paintings.\n[00:01:58] Images of naked people doing sexy stuff have been around for a long time.\n[00:02:02] Although, whether an image was considered\n[00:02:04] pornographic generally depended on the viewer’s cultural background.\n[00:02:07] European archaeologists were often the ones claiming these images were “obscene”\n[00:02:11] without understanding their cultural context.\n[00:02:13] And people haven’t just used explicit material to get all hot and bothered.\n[00:02:17] In 18th-century Europe, they also used it to spread illicit information about\n[00:02:21] contraception and women’s sexual freedom,\n[00:02:23] and to poke fun at the aristocracy.\n[00:02:25] Add this to the fact that porn was seen as depraved,\n[00:02:28] and you can see why its creators were often punished with jail time.\n[00:02:31] But that didn’t stop people from making more.\n[00:02:33] As time went on, and photography and film were invented,\n[00:02:36] visual porn became super popular.\n[00:02:38] And these days, the internet is home to more sexually explicit material than your\n[00:02:42] great-great-great-great-grandparents could have ever imagined.\n[00:02:47] So yes, porn is not new.\n[00:02:49] But what is new is the sheer amount and accessibility of it that we get from the internet.\n[00:02:54] And that comes with some benefits… and some downsides.\n[00:02:57] On the positive side, consuming porn\n[00:02:59] —and even sexy scenes in regular ol’ TV shows and movies—\n[00:03:02] may help destigmatize sex,\n[00:03:04] and provide people with a space to explore their sexuality,\n[00:03:07] especially if information about that kind of thing isn’t available in their IRL communities.\n[00:03:11] This can be particularly true for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n[00:03:16] Remember how the “Q” can stand for “questioning?”\n[00:03:18] Porn can help those folks figure out what they find sexy.\n[00:03:21] In fact, because education about anything but penis-in-vagina sex is hard to come by,\n[00:03:26] young LGBTQ+ people often learn the nuts and bolts of sex from porn.\n[00:03:30] Ultimately, everybody’s relationship with porn is different.\n[00:03:34] But truth be told, porn isn’t all fun and games, either.\n[00:03:37] One of the main reasons? Most of it is not realistic.\n[00:03:40] No matter how amateur the footage looks,\n[00:03:42] the vast majority of video porn is staged for the screen,\n[00:03:45] and the people involved are performers.\n[00:03:47] But that can be hard to remember.\n[00:03:49] If we just accept what happens in those scenes at face value,\n[00:03:52] it can lead to us picking up warped ideas about what sex should look like —\n[00:03:56] or what we should look like.\n[00:03:58] Multiple studies have found that the usually thin, hairless women\n[00:04:01] and chiseled dudes in porn can make young people feel bad about their own bodies,\n[00:04:05] just like airbrushed Instagram models or gym bro TikTokers can.\n[00:04:09] And when it comes to the experience of sex —\n[00:04:11] in pornographic videos, performers often fake orgasms,\n[00:04:15] because again, they’re performing.\n[00:04:18] Teen Shan: WHAT?! They fake orgasms?\n[00:04:20] I mean, I wouldn’t know. I don’t watch porn.\n[00:04:23] Shan: Mmmk. Yeah, Teen Shan.\n[00:04:25] They do fake orgasms.\n[00:04:26] And this can give viewers the false idea that\n[00:04:28] everyone’s going to respond the same way to certain sex acts,\n[00:04:31] and make them wonder if something’s wrong when it doesn’t play out that way.\n[00:04:35] And one of the most unrealistic parts of most\n[00:04:37] porn videos is that they don’t talk about the important stuff.\n[00:04:41] A lot of the time, they’re just naked people on a bed, and they start doing stuff.\n[00:04:45] No consent. No communication about desires.\n[00:04:47] And no protection.\n[00:04:48] People with penises often don’t wear condoms in porn—\n[00:04:51] let alone have a conversation about wearing one.\n[00:04:53] But in reality, talking to each other is one of the key ways to have good sex.\n[00:04:58] Many researchers and educators have also raised red flags about the amount\n[00:05:01] of violence and non-consensual aggression on popular porn sites,\n[00:05:05] especially because they can reflect harmful attitudes about women,\n[00:05:08] and especially women of color.\n[00:05:10] In a 2020 study of over four thousand porn scenes,\n[00:05:13] thirty-five to forty-five percent showed violence,\n[00:05:16] with women being the target ninety-seven percent of the time.\n[00:05:19] Another study showed that Black women were even\n[00:05:22] more likely than white women to be shown as the victims of violence,\n[00:05:25] and Black men were shown as aggressors more often than white men.\n[00:05:28] And the thing about the internet is,\n[00:05:29] you don’t even have to click on these videos\n[00:05:31] to see thumbnails and titles that use racial stereotypes and misogyny.\n[00:05:36] Historically, exploitation of performers has been a major part of the industry, too.\n[00:05:40] This is a complex issue that we won’t dive into today,\n[00:05:43] but know that many people who watch porn are getting more interested in how to do so ethically.\n[00:05:48] Now, as far as the research goes,\n[00:05:51] there’s no conclusive evidence about whether watching violent\n[00:05:53] or misogynistic porn makes someone more likely to act that way offline.\n[00:05:58] Some research, including a survey from 2019, found that respondents who viewed\n[00:06:02] violent porn were more likely to have perpetrated sexual violence,\n[00:06:06] but that doesn’t necessarily mean one causes the other.\n[00:06:09] And emerging research, including one study that surveyed almost\n[00:06:12] five thousand American college students, has found that choking\n[00:06:15] —an act popularized by video porn and other media like “Euphoria”—\n[00:06:19] has increased among young adults,\n[00:06:21] despite the fact that it’s not a safe thing to do, even when it’s consensual.\n[00:06:26] But long-term research is also sparse,\n[00:06:27] and different definitions of porn make it hard to compare findings.\n[00:06:31] And when it comes to misogyny, a lot of studies are at odds.\n[00:06:34] Some say that watching porn is correlated\n[00:06:36] with having sexist attitudes, while some say the opposite.\n[00:06:39] Also, scientists still don’t really know what high exposure to porn does to our brains.\n[00:06:44] If you want to learn more about the research that does exist,\n[00:06:46] you can visit our friends over at SciShow.\n[00:06:49] One way or another, though, porn is still… everywhere.\n[00:06:52] So what do we do with that?\n[00:06:54] The key is to think critically about what we see in porn,\n[00:06:57] and to make smart decisions about it:\n[00:06:59] a little thing called porn literacy.\n[00:07:01] Porn literacy is part of sexual literacy,\n[00:07:04] the critical thinking skills needed to have good sexual health.\n[00:07:07] And it’s not all that different from media literacy.\n[00:07:09] It involves a lot of the same concepts and skills you’d use\n[00:07:12] to identify the biases behind a news article,\n[00:07:15] or figure out if a photo was made by AI.\n[00:07:18] It also involves unpacking the assumptions we adopt from porn so that we don’t\n[00:07:22] spread misinformation or bring harmful behaviors or ideas into our sex lives.\n[00:07:26] Like, if you don’t see people wearing condoms or talking about contraception or STIs in porn,\n[00:07:32] what message is that sending you?\n[00:07:34] So, here are some questions you can ask yourself when\n[00:07:36] you come across a piece of pornographic media:\n[00:07:39] One: How does this make me feel?\n[00:07:42] Two: What is this trying to get me to think about sex or people?\n[00:07:46] Three: What about this might not be true to life?\n[00:07:50] Four: What’s missing from this piece of media?\n[00:07:53] And five: What sources of information can I trust about the stuff I’m seeing here?\n[00:07:58] That last question might be the trickiest —\n[00:08:00] but it’s an important one.\n[00:08:02] We all know we shouldn’t believe everything you see on the internet,\n[00:08:05] but that is where we get a lot of our information.\n[00:08:08] And some online sources are better than others.\n[00:08:10] Some reference research from doctors, sex therapists, and scientific journals.\n[00:08:14] While others… well, you’ve probably seen some of those TikToks.\n[00:08:18] Also, it’s worth noting that these\n[00:08:20] critical-thinking skills don’t just apply to explicit videos.\n[00:08:24] You can use these questions to analyze any information about sex you encounter,\n[00:08:28] from TV and movies to fanfiction and spicy romance novels.\n[00:08:31] Or my personal favorite medium: audio erotica.\n[00:08:35] ‘Cause the thing is: there’s nothing wrong with\n[00:08:38] wanting to explore your sexuality or responsibly seek out pleasure.\n[00:08:41] But like anything else,\n[00:08:43] it’s important to make sure we do so in a way that’s healthy, safe, and mindful.\n[00:08:48] Ultimately, not everybody watches porn on the regular,\n[00:08:50] and it’s certainly not a requirement for a happy sex life.\n[00:08:53] But for those who enjoy it,\n[00:08:55] it’s important to think critically about what’s being portrayed.\n[00:08:57] Because in the end, porn is designed to arouse and entertain.\n[00:09:01] But it’s not meant to educate—for that, you’ve got things like Crash Course.\n[00:09:05] Coming up next, we’re talking all about orgasms.\n[00:09:08] See you then.\n[00:09:08]

and\n[00:09:24] was made with the help of all these sexually literate people.\n[00:09:27] If you want to help keep Crash Course free for everyone, forever,\n[00:09:31] you can join the community on

      "text": "[00:00:00] Let’s be honest: if you’ve been on the internet,\n[00:00:02] you’ve probably seen porn.\n[00:00:03] Whether you went looking for it,\n[00:00:05] a friend shoved a video under your nose,\n[00:00:06] or you got a sketchy DM,\n[00:00:08] it’s hard not to come across porn in our extremely online world.\n[00:00:12] Either way, your first encounter with porn might have piqued your curiosity.\n[00:00:15] Or it might have even disturbed you.\n[00:00:17] It’s okay—we’re gonna unpack all of that together.\n[00:00:20] Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed.\n[00:00:23] [THEME MUSIC]\n[00:00:27] Head’s up: in today’s video, we’ll be talking about a sensitive topic,\n[00:00:31] including sexual assault and descriptions of certain kinds of sex acts.\n[00:00:35] So please keep that in mind and take care when watching.\n[00:00:37] We learn about sex from a lot of different sources.\n[00:00:40] But nobody seems to want to admit that for a lot of people,\n[00:00:43] one of their biggest teachers is pornography:\n[00:00:45] videos, films, magazines, and other forms of media that are meant for sexual arousal.\n[00:00:50] No matter what popped into your head when I first said “porn,”\n[00:00:53] the word has a pretty broad definition,\n[00:00:55] because what’s considered arousing can really vary from person to person.\n[00:00:59] In a Supreme Court case about which sexual material was obscene enough to censor,\n[00:01:03] one of the justices said porn was hard to define,\n[00:01:06] but “I know it when I see it.”\n[00:01:09] Whatever it is, porn is a part of our society.\n[00:01:11] Like, one survey from 2022 found that seventy-three percent of\n[00:01:15] teenagers may have seen porn online,\n[00:01:17] many before the age of thirteen,\n[00:01:19] despite the rise of age-restriction laws that require viewers to be eighteen or older.\n[00:01:24] Teen Shan: Well I definitely don’t watch porn.\n[00:01:26] Shan: Girl, I’m you. I know you’re lying.\n[00:01:29] But I don’t blame you.\n[00:01:30] ‘Cause here’s the thing:\n[00:01:31] The way sex ed classes and the adults in our lives talk about porn\n[00:01:34] — if they do at all —\n[00:01:36] is often full of shame.\n[00:01:37] And that leaves people with a sense that they shouldn’t ask questions.\n[00:01:40] But it turns out, one of the best ways\n[00:01:42] to responsibly engage with porn… is by getting curious.\n[00:01:46] The first thing to know?\n[00:01:47] Images that we might consider pornographic today have been around forever.\n[00:01:50] Peruvian sex pots sculpted fifteen hundred years ago,\n[00:01:53] frescoes from 1st-century Pompeii,\n[00:01:56] 17th-century erotic Japanese paintings.\n[00:01:58] Images of naked people doing sexy stuff have been around for a long time.\n[00:02:02] Although, whether an image was considered\n[00:02:04] pornographic generally depended on the viewer’s cultural background.\n[00:02:07] European archaeologists were often the ones claiming these images were “obscene”\n[00:02:11] without understanding their cultural context.\n[00:02:13] And people haven’t just used explicit material to get all hot and bothered.\n[00:02:17] In 18th-century Europe, they also used it to spread illicit information about\n[00:02:21] contraception and women’s sexual freedom,\n[00:02:23] and to poke fun at the aristocracy.\n[00:02:25] Add this to the fact that porn was seen as depraved,\n[00:02:28] and you can see why its creators were often punished with jail time.\n[00:02:31] But that didn’t stop people from making more.\n[00:02:33] As time went on, and photography and film were invented,\n[00:02:36] visual porn became super popular.\n[00:02:38] And these days, the internet is home to more sexually explicit material than your\n[00:02:42] great-great-great-great-grandparents could have ever imagined.\n[00:02:47] So yes, porn is not new.\n[00:02:49] But what is new is the sheer amount and accessibility of it that we get from the internet.\n[00:02:54] And that comes with some benefits… and some downsides.\n[00:02:57] On the positive side, consuming porn\n[00:02:59] —and even sexy scenes in regular ol’ TV shows and movies—\n[00:03:02] may help destigmatize sex,\n[00:03:04] and provide people with a space to explore their sexuality,\n[00:03:07] especially if information about that kind of thing isn’t available in their IRL communities.\n[00:03:11] This can be particularly true for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n[00:03:16] Remember how the “Q” can stand for “questioning?”\n[00:03:18] Porn can help those folks figure out what they find sexy.\n[00:03:21] In fact, because education about anything but penis-in-vagina sex is hard to come by,\n[00:03:26] young LGBTQ+ people often learn the nuts and bolts of sex from porn.\n[00:03:30] Ultimately, everybody’s relationship with porn is different.\n[00:03:34] But truth be told, porn isn’t all fun and games, either.\n[00:03:37] One of the main reasons? Most of it is not realistic.\n[00:03:40] No matter how amateur the footage looks,\n[00:03:42] the vast majority of video porn is staged for the screen,\n[00:03:45] and the people involved are performers.\n[00:03:47] But that can be hard to remember.\n[00:03:49] If we just accept what happens in those scenes at face value,\n[00:03:52] it can lead to us picking up warped ideas about what sex should look like —\n[00:03:56] or what we should look like.\n[00:03:58] Multiple studies have found that the usually thin, hairless women\n[00:04:01] and chiseled dudes in porn can make young people feel bad about their own bodies,\n[00:04:05] just like airbrushed Instagram models or gym bro TikTokers can.\n[00:04:09] And when it comes to the experience of sex —\n[00:04:11] in pornographic videos, performers often fake orgasms,\n[00:04:15] because again, they’re performing.\n[00:04:18] Teen Shan: WHAT?! They fake orgasms?\n[00:04:20] I mean, I wouldn’t know. I don’t watch porn.\n[00:04:23] Shan: Mmmk. Yeah, Teen Shan.\n[00:04:25] They do fake orgasms.\n[00:04:26] And this can give viewers the false idea that\n[00:04:28] everyone’s going to respond the same way to certain sex acts,\n[00:04:31] and make them wonder if something’s wrong when it doesn’t play out that way.\n[00:04:35] And one of the most unrealistic parts of most\n[00:04:37] porn videos is that they don’t talk about the important stuff.\n[00:04:41] A lot of the time, they’re just naked people on a bed, and they start doing stuff.\n[00:04:45] No consent. No communication about desires.\n[00:04:47] And no protection.\n[00:04:48] People with penises often don’t wear condoms in porn—\n[00:04:51] let alone have a conversation about wearing one.\n[00:04:53] But in reality, talking to each other is one of the key ways to have good sex.\n[00:04:58] Many researchers and educators have also raised red flags about the amount\n[00:05:01] of violence and non-consensual aggression on popular porn sites,\n[00:05:05] especially because they can reflect harmful attitudes about women,\n[00:05:08] and especially women of color.\n[00:05:10] In a 2020 study of over four thousand porn scenes,\n[00:05:13] thirty-five to forty-five percent showed violence,\n[00:05:16] with women being the target ninety-seven percent of the time.\n[00:05:19] Another study showed that Black women were even\n[00:05:22] more likely than white women to be shown as the victims of violence,\n[00:05:25] and Black men were shown as aggressors more often than white men.\n[00:05:28] And the thing about the internet is,\n[00:05:29] you don’t even have to click on these videos\n[00:05:31] to see thumbnails and titles that use racial stereotypes and misogyny.\n[00:05:36] Historically, exploitation of performers has been a major part of the industry, too.\n[00:05:40] This is a complex issue that we won’t dive into today,\n[00:05:43] but know that many people who watch porn are getting more interested in how to do so ethically.\n[00:05:48] Now, as far as the research goes,\n[00:05:51] there’s no conclusive evidence about whether watching violent\n[00:05:53] or misogynistic porn makes someone more likely to act that way offline.\n[00:05:58] Some research, including a survey from 2019, found that respondents who viewed\n[00:06:02] violent porn were more likely to have perpetrated sexual violence,\n[00:06:06] but that doesn’t necessarily mean one causes the other.\n[00:06:09] And emerging research, including one study that surveyed almost\n[00:06:12] five thousand American college students, has found that choking\n[00:06:15] —an act popularized by video porn and other media like “Euphoria”—\n[00:06:19] has increased among young adults,\n[00:06:21] despite the fact that it’s not a safe thing to do, even when it’s consensual.\n[00:06:26] But long-term research is also sparse,\n[00:06:27] and different definitions of porn make it hard to compare findings.\n[00:06:31] And when it comes to misogyny, a lot of studies are at odds.\n[00:06:34] Some say that watching porn is correlated\n[00:06:36] with having sexist attitudes, while some say the opposite.\n[00:06:39] Also, scientists still don’t really know what high exposure to porn does to our brains.\n[00:06:44] If you want to learn more about the research that does exist,\n[00:06:46] you can visit our friends over at SciShow.\n[00:06:49] One way or another, though, porn is still… everywhere.\n[00:06:52] So what do we do with that?\n[00:06:54] The key is to think critically about what we see in porn,\n[00:06:57] and to make smart decisions about it:\n[00:06:59] a little thing called porn literacy.\n[00:07:01] Porn literacy is part of sexual literacy,\n[00:07:04] the critical thinking skills needed to have good sexual health.\n[00:07:07] And it’s not all that different from media literacy.\n[00:07:09] It involves a lot of the same concepts and skills you’d use\n[00:07:12] to identify the biases behind a news article,\n[00:07:15] or figure out if a photo was made by AI.\n[00:07:18] It also involves unpacking the assumptions we adopt from porn so that we don’t\n[00:07:22] spread misinformation or bring harmful behaviors or ideas into our sex lives.\n[00:07:26] Like, if you don’t see people wearing condoms or talking about contraception or STIs in porn,\n[00:07:32] what message is that sending you?\n[00:07:34] So, here are some questions you can ask yourself when\n[00:07:36] you come across a piece of pornographic media:\n[00:07:39] One: How does this make me feel?\n[00:07:42] Two: What is this trying to get me to think about sex or people?\n[00:07:46] Three: What about this might not be true to life?\n[00:07:50] Four: What’s missing from this piece of media?\n[00:07:53] And five: What sources of information can I trust about the stuff I’m seeing here?\n[00:07:58] That last question might be the trickiest —\n[00:08:00] but it’s an important one.\n[00:08:02] We all know we shouldn’t believe everything you see on the internet,\n[00:08:05] but that is where we get a lot of our information.\n[00:08:08] And some online sources are better than others.\n[00:08:10] Some reference research from doctors, sex therapists, and scientific journals.\n[00:08:14] While others… well, you’ve probably seen some of those TikToks.\n[00:08:18] Also, it’s worth noting that these\n[00:08:20] critical-thinking skills don’t just apply to explicit videos.\n[00:08:24] You can use these questions to analyze any information about sex you encounter,\n[00:08:28] from TV and movies to fanfiction and spicy romance novels.\n[00:08:31] Or my personal favorite medium: audio

      "text": "[00:00:49] It is exactly the time to be talking about climate change because the events leading\n[00:00:53] to these bushfires were heightened, or the increased risk of bushfires, is linked to\n[00:00:59] climate change.\n[00:01:00] So, in Australia we know that climate change is driving hotter temperatures, more prolonged\n[00:01:07] droughts and that means that out forests are drier, there´s fuel loads there that will\n[00:01:12] quickly and easily burn and as we saw over this summer and they did burn and they burnt\n[00:01:18] very quickly and much quicker and hotter than in any other previous years.\n[00:01:23] And these were also fires that were predicted by both chief scientists around the world,\n[00:01:31] including in Australia.\n[00:01:33] Firefighters were calling out and speaking directly to Morrison and the federal government\n[00:01:38] about the heightened bushfire risk this summer and we saw it happen in our own backyard.\n[00:01:47] We´ve known for about 40 years now that climate change is happening, and it is now actually\n[00:01:55] accelerating and happening at a faster rate than a lot of people predicted.\n[00:01:59] Ah, and as we have seen in Australia, these fire events are basically systematic of increased\n[00:02:06] temperatures, prolonged droughts, very little rain and our forests burnt really quickly\n[00:02:13] and really severely.\n[00:02:19] The estimate is nearly a billion mammals, birds and reptiles.\n[00:02:23] That doesn´t include all of the, probably trillions, of invertebrates that died.\n[00:02:28] It doesn´t include other animals like bats.\n[00:02:30] So, it really is an underestimate and we have a lot of populations in Australia, especially\n[00:02:36] small mammals - that are small to medium-sized mammals – that are threatened with extinction.\n[00:02:43] So, we probably expect, potentially from localised extinction events as a result of these fires.\n[00:02:52] Really, we´re trying to understand what is happening and what is going on out there but\n[00:02:58] I wouldn´t say that it would be very good.\n[00:03:04] We really need a global response to combat the impacts of climate change.\n[00:03:13] Recently, in a paper that co-authored and that was co-signed by around 11, 000 scientists\n[00:03:18] around the world, we put forward six steps which we think are important for the world\n[00:03:25] to undertake, including Australia, to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n[00:03:30] So, number one is energy.\n[00:03:32] So, a massive shift in the way that we produce our energy; away from fossil fuels and using\n[00:03:38] renewable energy sources.\n[00:03:40] The second step is reducing short-lived pollutants.\n[00:03:44] It includes Co2 and methane and black soot.\n[00:03:48] Basically, cutting that out.\n[00:03:50] Thirdly, we need to protect and restore nature.\n[00:03:53] Nature is one of our best allies.\n[00:03:56] Trees to soak up our carbon.\n[00:03:59] We need to protect what we´ve got.\n[00:04:01] We need to basically stop land-clearing and look at restoring the forests that are being\n[00:04:06] land-cleared, at you know, accelerating rates.\n[00:04:11] We need to shift the way we produce and consume our food.\n[00:04:15] In short, that means reducing meat consumption: beef and lamb, and shifting to more of a plant-based\n[00:04:22] food sources.\n[00:04:24] We need to look at how our economy is driving and how it is operating.\n[00:04:30] And really shift away from a focus on increasing GDP and increasing wealth to looking at how\n[00:04:36] we can have sustainable distribution of wealth across both the developed and developing countries\n[00:04:43] and to all work together to basically change the way our economies are driving.\n[00:04:47] Finally, you know, the greatest source of this source of this carbon is human population.\n[00:04:55] It´s something that a lot of people don´t talk about but reducing population growth\n[00:05:01] should be one of the global goals in combating, basically, the human footprint and the impact\n[00:05:07] humans are causing on planet earth.\n[00:05:14] My message in regards to climate change is that we need a global response, a rapid response,\n[00:05:20] to change the way we produce our energy.\n[00:05:23] We need to reduce Co2 emissions and restore and protect nature.\n[00:05:29] We need to do this at al global level if we are to mitigate the impacts of climate change\n[00:05:34] in Australia; like we have seen with the massive fires that have gone through here, and globally.\n\n\n",

      "text": "[00:00:05] Microsoft founder and former richest man\n[00:00:07] in the world, Bill Gates, surprised many\n[00:00:09] people with an essay that he published\n[00:00:11] on Tuesday. Now, Gates has long been a\n[00:00:13] vocal activist for fighting against\n[00:00:15] climate change, donating billions of\n[00:00:17] dollars to support climate research and\n[00:00:19] investments. But in his essay, Gates\n[00:00:21] writes that a strategic pivot is\n[00:00:23] necessary in the fight against climate\n[00:00:25] change, and that some of the money spent\n[00:00:26] on it should be redirected elsewhere.\n[00:00:29] Gates says in part, quote, \"Our chief\n[00:00:31] goal should be to prevent suffering,\n[00:00:33] particularly for those in the toughest\n[00:00:34] conditions who live in the world's\n[00:00:36] poorest countries. Although climate\n[00:00:37] change will hurt poor people more than\n[00:00:39] anyone else, for the vast majority of\n[00:00:41] them, it will not be the only or even\n[00:00:43] the biggest threat to their lives and\n[00:00:44] welfare. The biggest problems are\n[00:00:46] poverty, disease, just as they always\n[00:00:48] have been.\" He then listed his three\n[00:00:51] tough truths about climate change. The\n[00:00:53] first one says, \"Climate change is a\n[00:00:54] serious problem, but will not be the end\n[00:00:56] of civilization.\" The second says\n[00:00:58] temperature is not the best way to\n[00:01:00] measure our progress on climate. And\n[00:01:02] lastly, health and prosperity are the\n[00:01:04] best defense against climate change.\n[00:01:06] Gates went on to say that he knows some\n[00:01:08] people will call him a hypocrite for\n[00:01:09] saying this, but he expanded on his\n[00:01:10] thoughts in an interview with CNBC.\n[00:01:13] Shouldn't we in our awareness of how\n[00:01:17] little generosity there is to help\n[00:01:20] measure, you know, should we get them a\n[00:01:23] measles vaccine or should we do some\n[00:01:26] climate uh related activity? And if if\n[00:01:30] we could take if we stopped putting all\n[00:01:32] vaccines and that, you know, saved you\n[00:01:34] 0.1 degree, would that be a smart\n[00:01:37] tradeoff? That's the kind of question we\n[00:01:40] have to ask. Uh, so I'm a climate\n[00:01:43] activist, but I'm also a child survival\n[00:01:46] activist.\n[00:01:47] Now, some people online viewed Gates\n[00:01:49] essay as him turning his back on his old\n[00:01:51] beliefs. Maxwell Meyer, writing for\n[00:01:53] Arena Magazine, writes on X, \"This is a\n[00:01:55] white flag from someone who fought hard\n[00:01:57] for an insane set of ideas and lost.\"\n[00:02:00] Daily Wire reporter Megan Basham says,\n[00:02:02] \"Here's what I know. Stick to what you\n[00:02:03] know to be true long enough and\n[00:02:05] eventually the fever passes, fashionable\n[00:02:07] trends crumble, and you can hold your\n[00:02:08] head high knowing that you never bought\n[00:02:11] into the consensus.\n[00:02:12] Now, Gates's comments come ahead of the\n[00:02:14] United Nations Climate Change\n[00:02:16] Conference. The 30th annual meeting is\n[00:02:18] held in Brazil from November 10th to\n[00:02:20] November 21st.\n[00:02:22] Well, I welcome uh Bill Gates to club uh\n[00:02:26] reality uh which is not that climate\n[00:02:28] change is not happening or that it's\n[00:02:30] made up or anything like that.\n[00:02:32] human activity. Well, the climate has\n[00:02:34] been changing for hundreds and hundreds\n[00:02:37] of for as long as there was climate on\n[00:02:39] planet Earth. And human activity does\n[00:02:42] contribute to it. That's not in\n[00:02:44] contention. But the more um uh\n[00:02:48] apocalyptic predictions of climate of\n[00:02:51] people active on that issue did not come\n[00:02:53] true. You know, from ridiculous things\n[00:02:54] to, you know, there's going to be the\n[00:02:56] extinction event. It's all there's\n[00:02:58] overcrowding, overpopulation, all that\n[00:03:00] stuff. None of it happened. Uh which is\n[00:03:02] good. And just prioritizing uh fighting\n[00:03:07] rises in temperature if that comes as if\n[00:03:10] the trade-off is living miserably or or\n[00:03:13] starvation or\n[00:03:15] the uh disease mitigation efforts\n[00:03:18] thwarted in the third world. That would\n[00:03:20] not be worthy trade-offs. So I agree\n[00:03:23] with what he's saying here completely.\n[00:03:25] Um that this was not his position prior,\n[00:03:27] but he's landed in the in the correct\n[00:03:29] place. I wonder if you know like liberal\n[00:03:31] left climate activist people their hair\n[00:03:33] is going to be on fire because of this\n[00:03:35] contributing to the hole in the ozone\n[00:03:37] with their burning hair follicules. But\n[00:03:40] um this is what this is what people I've\n[00:03:42] listened to um Michael Shelonburgger and\n[00:03:45] who's you know been a guest on our\n[00:03:47] program multiple times what he's been\n[00:03:49] saying for years. So uh welcome welcome\n[00:03:51] to the team.\n[00:03:52] Well I am for one not a hysterical\n[00:03:54] climate activist. Um, I do think what\n[00:03:56] Bill Gates was saying is that climate\n[00:03:58] change does matter, but maybe the way\n[00:03:59] that we talk about it is causing more\n[00:04:01] harm than good and even to the poorest\n[00:04:03] people. I would look at it this way\n[00:04:04] instead of the climate activists who I\n[00:04:06] believe have good intentions feeling\n[00:04:08] like Bill Gates is now undercutting them\n[00:04:09] because\n[00:04:10] I'm sure they do have good intentions.\n[00:04:11] Well, I think that I would I like to\n[00:04:12] believe\n[00:04:14] at paintings.\n[00:04:15] Fine.\n[00:04:15] Those people we can talk about the worst\n[00:04:16] type of protest then we can talk about\n[00:04:18] an overall movement.\n[00:04:19] The temperature got 10 degrees higher.\n[00:04:21] Okay. That's what it makes me want to do\n[00:04:22] when they throw stupid paintings.\n[00:04:24] Instead of climate activists feeling\n[00:04:25] like he's trying to undercut them, since\n[00:04:27] he did describe himself still as a\n[00:04:28] climate activist, maybe this could\n[00:04:30] finally be a bridge to have a\n[00:04:31] conversation with people that are in\n[00:04:33] power on both sides of the aisle that\n[00:04:35] think that maybe the hysterics weren't\n[00:04:37] necessary, but the conversation still is\n[00:04:39] to figure out a real way to have less\n[00:04:41] dramatic conversations about solutions.\n[00:04:43] It doesn't have to be number one on the\n[00:04:44] list. I think he's acknowledging that,\n[00:04:46] but it needs to be on the list. And so\n[00:04:47] that's where to start instead of being\n[00:04:49] like, \"Oh my gosh, the roof is on fire.\n[00:04:50] We have to do something right now.\" the\n[00:04:51] world's going to end. Like that was\n[00:04:52] never a good starting point because some\n[00:04:54] people were looking at today and right\n[00:04:55] now and saying yes, it's hysterical. I\n[00:04:57] told you I'm not um hysterical. I do\n[00:04:59] think that he's trying to take a more of\n[00:05:00] a pragmatic angle which also will lead\n[00:05:03] to hopefully future real solutions. We\n[00:05:05] should be mindful of our environment. I\n[00:05:06] don't think it's a bad thing that people\n[00:05:08] the hysterical part I you could do away\n[00:05:09] with, but we should all be mindful and\n[00:05:11] treat our environment better, right? We\n[00:05:12] want we talk you talk about how the\n[00:05:14] economy and the government and the money\n[00:05:16] we spend will be terrible situation for\n[00:05:17] our kids. Well, guess what? If they\n[00:05:19] don't have an earth to live in because\n[00:05:20] we trash it, then that's also not going\n[00:05:22] to be great for them, too. So, we could\n[00:05:24] all do better with that, right? Stop\n[00:05:25] littering. Stop doing those things.\n[00:05:27] Maybe stop using the can spray.\n[00:05:28] Yeah. Stop littering. We can all do\n[00:05:30] better. We don't want to live in filth\n[00:05:31] and squalor anyway. So,\n[00:05:33] yeah. So, we can we can all just take\n[00:05:34] care of regardless of the I don't think\n[00:05:36] you can say that's a bad mission to say\n[00:05:38] that people who cared about the climate\n[00:05:40] and the how that contributes to the\n[00:05:42] deterioration of the world are bad\n[00:05:44] people. That's not a bad intention.\n[00:05:45] They're caring about the things out\n[00:05:46] there. Now, the hysterical part, I'll\n[00:05:48] agree with you, but I'll never like bash\n[00:05:49] a climate activist just because they\n[00:05:51] want to make our world better. But why?\n[00:05:53] I don't think those types of\n[00:05:55] I like her a lot.\n[00:05:56] Oh, she's\n[00:05:57] Well, you were her age. What were you\n[00:05:58] doing, Robbie? That's a noble young\n[00:06:00] girl.\n[00:06:00] I was in school.\n[00:06:01] Exactly. But she's doing something\n[00:06:02] noble. She's fighting for what she\n[00:06:03] believes in. Okay. I don't think she\n[00:06:04] needs to go back to school. I think\n[00:06:06] she's doing\n[00:06:06] I think she's dumb, but that's fine. Uh\n[00:06:08] dumb.\n[00:06:10] That's like such strong language for a\n[00:06:11] young girl who's inspiring millions. I\n[00:06:13] don't have to I don't have to. Oh, she's\n[00:06:15] inspire I don't have to agree with her.\n[00:06:17] But dumb. This is a young girl who's\n[00:06:19] fighting for what she believes in. Why\n[00:06:20] is that dumb?\n[00:06:21] She doesn't know what she's talking\n[00:06:22] about. She is exactly the kind of\n[00:06:23] hysterical anti-progress human being I'm\n[00:06:26] describing. Because the best way, here's\n[00:06:28] the policy. The best way to mitigate the\n[00:06:31] harms of climate change is is improved\n[00:06:35] technological innovation, which requires\n[00:06:37] energy use and requires uh it requires\n[00:06:40] capitalism to be unleashed. requires us\n[00:06:42] to free the inventive, productive\n[00:06:45] sectors of the economy to find new and\n[00:06:47] innovative innovative ways to produce\n[00:06:50] energy more efficiently and more\n[00:06:51] cheaply. And that requires less\n[00:06:53] government regulation, less subsidies\n[00:06:55] for existing um uh for existing uh\n[00:06:58] sources of energy. It just requires\n[00:07:01] getting governments out of the way. And\n[00:07:03] that's not the set of policies that uh\n[00:07:05] progressive activist type people ever\n[00:07:07] favor.\n[00:07:07] Like Bill Gates,\n[00:07:08] like Greta Dunberg.\n[00:07:10] Okay. But Bill, maybe Bill Gates is open\n[00:07:11] to that conversation, which is a great\n[00:07:13] thing that that to me that's a good\n[00:07:14] thing. I also think, you know, he's\n[00:07:16] calling for a little bit of balance.\n[00:07:17] He's calling for innovation. I mean,\n[00:07:18] this is one of the most innovative guys\n[00:07:20] in our history.\n[00:07:21] Nuclear power plants was a huge mistake\n[00:07:24] because nuclear power, I know we all\n[00:07:26] Chernobyl. Oh, nuclear power is very\n[00:07:29] isob\n[00:07:31] compared to some of the compared to\n[00:07:33] fossil fuels. So, you should move from\n[00:07:35] fossil fuels to nuclear. and then and\n[00:07:38] then when possible, when it's\n[00:07:40] economically productive to do so to wind\n[00:07:43] and solar and whatever else, fine. But\n[00:07:46] you can't force that. You can't just\n[00:07:48] say, \"Oh, we we we you know, we we\n[00:07:49] banished uh we banished coal.\"\n[00:07:51] And especially I agree with you. And\n[00:07:52] especially if that money is is taking\n[00:07:54] away from helping some of the poorest in\n[00:07:56] our world to accomplish missions of\n[00:07:57] solar power in the US or elsewhere to\n[00:07:59] make our climate more like that's not\n[00:08:01] that's not effective, right? If the\n[00:08:02] world's suffering on behalf of getting\n[00:08:04] more solar panels, we got to figure out\n[00:08:06] how to keep people.\n[00:08:06] Also, people make ridiculous claims like\n[00:08:08] every time now there's a hurricane or an\n[00:08:10] earthquake or whatever, people say, \"Oh,\n[00:08:12] see what climate change isaus.\"\n[00:08:14] Well, hurricane is caused by the warmth,\n[00:08:16] I believe.\n[00:08:16] No, there has been there's no\n[00:08:18] statistical correlation. The water is\n[00:08:20] changing climate change and more severe\n[00:08:22] weather events. Fewer people, but fewer\n[00:08:25] people die in in advanced countries from\n[00:08:28] severe weather events than ever before\n[00:08:30] because even though we've warmed the\n[00:08:31] temperature ever so slightly and warmed\n[00:08:33] the waters ever so slightly, we've built\n[00:08:35] more reinforced buildings because of the\n[00:08:38] That's what Bill Gates So what about the\n[00:08:39] poor people then?\n[00:08:40] Well, so we need to make available to\n[00:08:43] them the same kind of developments and\n[00:08:45] and that takes\n[00:08:46] maybe more precedence over\n[00:08:47] Exactly. Exactly. so we can mitigate\n[00:08:49] them.\n[00:08:49] So hopefully Bill Gates comes to the\n[00:08:51] table and has more of these\n[00:08:52] conversations. Now, former President\n[00:08:53] Barack Obama reportedly was going off on\n[00:08:56] Nancy Pelosi in a tense phone call last\n[00:08:58] year. The new bombshell report from\n[00:09:00] Jonathan Carl's new book, Retribution,\n[00:09:02] coming up. We'll be right back.\n[00:09:06] [Music]\n\n\n",

      "text": "00:00:00\n[Music] senator Sanders thank you so much for making some time we sometimes hear journalists talk about climate change as a ratings killer and basically ignoring the existential crisis facing humanity as oppose for killing the planet right so you have decided to put on a TV show tell me why you've decided to do a town hall on climate change we have found that on some of the most important issues facing this country in the world corporate media generally speaking is not there now you tell me income and\n\n00:00:39\nwealth inequality you seen any good specials on NBC or ABC lately no you haven't we're the only country major country on Earth doesn't guarantee healthcare all any great discussions on television about the need for Medicare for all even a debate about the issue you have it so what we have done is working with progressive media outlets and this is pretty revolutionary if I must say so myself we have come together to produce town meetings and the one we did on income and wealth inequality had well\n\n00:01:08\nover a million and a half viewers more than CNN had on that evening that is extraordinarily important because what we are saying is you can get around corporate media you can talk about real issues and you know what the American people are prepared me to deal with it now when you talk about real issues I would think that maybe the survival of the planet that we live on might be an issue of some concern to some people right all right and you know this stuff bit of the night and thank you for all\n\n00:01:37\nthe work you have done on it the IPCC including some of the best climate scientists in the world had concluded that a lot of their previous estimates were wrong that they were too conservative that the that the crisis is worse than they anticipated and they're telling us that we have 12 years 12 yes no time at all to transform our energy system to prevent horrific damage and you know one thing I just want to interject is that when people hear that they think oh I'll start in twenty twelve years no that's not what\n\n00:02:12\nthey said in by twelve years from now we have to basically cut our fossil fuel consumption in half which means no time at all which is dealing not just you know you know with the guy we have in the White House who doesn't even acknowledge the problem all right you got three countries all over the world together it's not an American problem it's a Chinese problem in Indian problem etc etc so it is a monumental task the only bright side that I see to it is that if we can get the word out to our\n\n00:02:41\nfriends all over the world especially to the young people in groups like three fifty.org and others then doing a great job in this think about what it would mean to the entire planet for people in China and Russia and India standing up together transforming our energy system and creating millions of jobs as we doing it and when you do that you end a lot of the pollution that way now so instead of going to war you know war is always a way that you rally people together right think about a war against\n\n00:03:10\nclimate change an international war against climate change this is one of the I think promises of the idea of a green new deal right because it brings together the economic stimulus which makes it kind of recession proof because one of the things that we've seen is during economic downturns then all of the whatever momentum there is towards climate action disappears so what is it what does a green new deal mean to you what it means is several fold number one obviously we are moving boldly to reduce\n\n00:03:42\ncarbon emissions okay and that means transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel to a energy efficiency we are a very wasteful energy society be moving toward the electrification of our transportation system which is a huge deal and see making buildings all across this country and the world much more energy efficient now the last time there was a new deal in the United it did create a huge amount of jobs but there were people excluded from the benefits of some of the big gains in the New Deal period african-american workers\n\n00:04:20\nnot all of them but many of them domestic workers farm workers we we are in a moment where there's a huge amount of momentum coming from a climate justice movement from from frontline communities so I want to know what your thinking is about how to make sure that a green new deal doesn't replicate the exclusions of the old news that's it that's a great question and by the way we know that not just we know that climate change will impact internationally most significantly the poorest people in the world that's what\n\n00:04:54\nwe know in this country we know that if you go to places like the South Bronx in New York City you got a quarter of the kids who are dealing with asthma because of a variety of pollution so a moving aggressively to transform our energy system will help some of the poorest people in this country and in the world your point is they have got to be involved that that part of our population has got to be involved in the solution as well that means rebuilding communities in a green way involving absolutely in a significant way people\n\n00:05:29\nfrom the Latino community from the african-american community from all of our communities but I look at it you know looking at maybe as a politician I see the incredible possibilities as a nation not only in combating climate change which is the bottom line that's our survival but think about what it means when young people suddenly are rebuilding their own communities in minority communities what an extraordinary thing that will be economically and socially yeah and we are in this moment where these are the\n\n00:05:59\ncommunities that have the most to lose but they are also the communities that have the most to gain and and and are mobilizing and so another question I have for you is I mean people people are wondering how can this possibly happen we don't have control over the Senate its control of the house but we don't know what's going to happen in 2020 what is the role of social movements in in pushing this forward the future rests with the success of grassroots activism look you have a Congress which is forget\n\n00:06:28\nthe moment where you have a president who what can we say who is a pathological liar who doesn't understand the first thing it doesn't even think thinks climate change is a hoax forgetting him for getting a Congress which is heavily dominated by the fossil fuel industry and the Koch brothers forget them all right what we need all over this country in an unprecedented way we are fighting I have you know a man this life is a cup seven beautiful grandchildren and you have a six-year-old right if we do not get our\n\n00:06:57\nact together I worry about the planet that we're going to be leaving to these beautiful children we just saw and I want everybody to understand us you know we just saw what happened in California you saw was it 88 people who ended up or more right we don't know who died 14,000 homes did you know 14,000 homes were destroyed and what the scientists are telling us this is the future this is not going to be the exception to the rule heat waves in Europe the acidification of the ocean what the hell does that\n\n00:07:27\nmean in terms of people able to fishing and so from ammolite so to answer your question the grass roots of this country has got to stand up so it's a food security threat and it is a security threat on every front coming back to the town hall that you have plans you're gonna have alexandria el castillo Cortez with you my understanding is that there's now 18 members of the House who are backing the idea of a select committee for a green new deal but there's also a feeling of well this\n\n00:07:56\nisn't respecting the way things are done in Congress and we have our committees and we have our hierarchies what's your what's your response what do you think well I haven't been in the house for a number of years looking it to me it doesn't matter whether it's a select committee or the general committee probably a select committee would be a better idea what matters that we get it done and we debt it done very quickly so here is my prayer to my colleagues in you remember way back in 96 with Newt\n\n00:08:27\nGingrich they remember he did 94 yeah Gingrich came in with an a right-wing agenda I was in the house at that point yeah and this guy had the house working 20 hours a day I was there morning noon and night pushing his right-wing extremist agenda which by the way laid the groundwork for where we are today I would hope that the leadership of the Democratic Party in the house we have to work with them hand-in-hand in a sense learns that lesson and comes forward with a progressive agenda climate change\n\n00:09:02\nis at the top let's make the American people understand we're going to create millions of jobs we're gonna lower fuel bills we are gonna protect those people who will lose their jobs and as we transform the energy system there will be some people who lose jobs we've got to protect those people can't forget about them we got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage we got to move toward health care for all we can learn something from your native country Canada on that tell the American people\n\n00:09:31\nthat we have heard their pain and that we are going to go forward in a you know in an urgent matter that we go forward strongly and not just diddle around that's my field thank you so much Bernie it was such a pleasure you\n\n\n\n",

local state and urban policy he's currently a public policy fellow with the Wilson centers Canada Institute Barry welcome to now thanks for joining us thank you John among your many credits I should also say you co-direct the national survey on energy and environment a twice annual survey of American public views on climate change and related issues a new\n\n00:00:27\nreport coming out as we speak but before I ask you about that I want to set the the broader context by asking to get your first reaction to the Paris climate deal is this more or less uh exceeding expectations about what you expected where does it fall this is a big deal it perhaps somewhat exceeds expectations and yet it is not a done deal because the day after the months after will really determine whether or not this is a significant transition point or not it's no secret that the predecessors to\n\n00:00:58\nParis the Kyoto Protocol and other intern National meetings have struggled mightily with this kind of a policy problem where clearly there is a need for all the nations of the world to collaborate and cooperate but getting them on the same page and then imposing or establishing those policies that are needed been hugely hugely challenging some successes some non successes Paris begins to bind together a wide wide number of pledges or promises that hundreds literally of Nations have made going into this meeting about what\n\n00:01:27\nthey're going to do with their energy and climate emissions over over a decade or more with a mechanism to review that every five years or so but again what happens when those Ministers of State return to their National capitals including the Washington DC context and proceed on these issues Canada much the same issue is really hard to know at this point and knowing whether there's going to be momentum Beyond Paris on this we' already heard Rumblings from politicians who are opposed to the\n\n00:01:53\nagreement so it's there there's going to be that and you mentioned pledges and Promises we're not talking about uh enforcable uh standards this is compliance by volunteer basis essentially this does not create an international police force to monitor with sanctions to be sure we see pledges for where emissions are going to be over time we see pledges over how much money Nations like Canada and the US will be putting into the pot and sharing with developing economies so they can participate in some of these\n\n00:02:25\ntechnological and energy transitions as well there's a a monitoring system system in place to actually measure what is or is not being done or is or is not being accomplished but the sanctions for that really don't exist it's it's a little more than an honor System if you will but it's still largely assuming that every nation will honor whatever it is that they said they were going to do and coming to to this agreement uh and if if they do let's be optimistic if they do are we are we into the game Cher that\n\n00:02:54\nsome have been waiting for in terms of a real move away from a fossil fuel economy and something that could gain momentum and and be transformational there really could be a transformation already underway intriguing just in the last few weeks during the Paris meetings we began to get data that suggested that the rate of greenhouse gas emissions has been growing globally in the last couple of years less than we anticipated a kind of stabilization that's partly due to countries like the United States Canada\n\n00:03:24\nEuropean Union but also China and India beginning to to bend that curve back a little for a number of factors so there's some thinking that this is beginning to emerge we've seen progress on this front in the US with a drop of roughly 10% over the last CH years in our greenhouse gas emissions without a binding National commitment so there's some reason even before the Paris agreement that change could be underfoot and then perhaps Paris could accelerate again though all of this is contingent\n\n00:03:52\non Goodwill follow through amongst the nations of the world and on climate like a wide range of other issues that's not a slam dunk by any means one thing about tipping points is often they're impossible to identify in real time it's only with hindsight that you can realize that something just happened the let me ask you about your survey your latest release of of data and if you could tie it to this discussion of the climate deal and any momentum that is building what are the latest findings what do\n\n00:04:20\nthey indicate and do they speak to some sort of growing momentum there may be some signs here that that's the case then this is a a national telephone survey of a national audience landline users and cell phone users in the United States that's a partnership between the University of Michigan and mberg college we began this work in the fall of 2008 which is interesting to think about because some argue that was a a high Watermark of concern at least in the United States on climate issues it was\n\n00:04:46\nthe time the president was President Obama was elected for the first term and expectations that the US was really going to move on this so we've seen now in the surveys we've done for this fall and comparing them to earlier ones that there has been a rise up in American concern on this issue belief that warming global temperatures are are real that they see evidence of this a jump back up to the 70% level on that question for the first time really since 2008 uh and with it support for a fairly\n\n00:05:16\nbroad range of policy initiatives in the study that that you're talking about also that we were about to release um information on how Americans feel about the latest component of American climate policy president Obama's clean power plan which has gained a lot of attention in Washington and nationally and there we asked a sample of Americans across the country how they would like their state to respond to this new mandate placed by the federal government on each state that reduces their emissions from\n\n00:05:46\nthe electric power sector a big part of this issue over the next 15 years or so there we found a fairly broad base of support for the idea that people want their states to enter into negotiation with the federal government to develop a plan and actually support for a wide range but not all of the possible ways that they might get to that path majority support 53% if I remember correctly so so uh when you look around the globe or at other countries where you have some similar data to your studies where where does the America\n\n00:06:19\nwhere does the United States sit are we uh ahead of the curve behind the curve where are we the US in some ways has been behind the curve at least in terms of this threshold of do you believe global warming is occurring do you believe that this is significant or human causation there if you compare the US certainly with Canada but the European Union and other countries there's been a pretty substantial Gap especially in the last few years between the US and almost all of these other countries well I I think I I've heard\n\n00:06:46\nthat read that we're the only industrialized democracy with a major political party that denies global warming that's right this was really an interesting feature of the Paris Accords where in previous International meetings an opposition party or even a party in government in another country would show up on the scene and say we don't think climate change is occurring much less that action should be taken uh the US really does Remain the outlier here amongst almost all the major nations in\n\n00:07:14\nthe world in having a major political party and substantial political force that not only is Raising questions about the Paris agreements and what they might mean for their own country but is actually raising questions about whether there's even evidence that that that global warming has been occurring does any of your research give you a hint as to why that might be why the US Remains the outlier we do indeed see however we ask these questions John very strong cleavage in terms of political\n\n00:07:41\npartisanship Republican versus Democrat and yet in some respects on this last survey that we took again the the fall survey of this year uh the cleavage seemed to be declining somewhat and in some respects less differences we actually attribute that among to a number of factors one is that people clearly respond to in cue off of relatively recent experience with weather and whether it's weather experiences in their own neighborhood or being a greater aware of drought in the US or even reacting to Pope Francis in\n\n00:08:11\nhis message with which Americans across the political Spectrum in our survey really do resonate to some extent on this particular issue that seems to be changing somewhat and yet at the end of the day when you ask Republicans and Democrats on this question in a great many ways you get still significantly different answers and hence that may explain some of the partisan cleavage we see so it sounds like what you're describing is more a case of identity politics rather than a scientific inquiry there's clearly not a lot of\n\n00:08:38\nevidence that any Americans have time to dive deeply into the vast vast scientific literature on this and so where do we look for information and cues uh you know clearly there are a range of media and informational Outlets but we also realize that people often turn to gee what happened in my own backyard how was the weather how was the winter snow effect these kinds of things or how that might be interpreted by local meteorologists and the like this is a very complex multifaceted process and yet across the spectrum of public\n\n00:09:08\npolicy and Science and Technology issues any citizen only has so much time to devote to it unless they happen to be particular Specialists and so we all take our cues and we think that this is going on in this case with the interesting issue of whether or not this transition that we're beginning to see globally on this issue is also really beginning to kick in in the United States in Canada by the way we've just not seen this big jump and shift uh in in in public opinion over recent years\n\n00:09:31\nthat we have in the US in fact we had a Wilson Center events state has stay more stable in in Canada much more stable and at a much higher level of belief that this is real and a real concern two final questions Barry one a bit of business and then I'll ask the other the first the business where the people who want to see the most recent survey on the power plants and then those who want to see your ongoing research where can they find this sure uh the publication home for most of our reports is closeup\n\n00:09:55\nthe center for local state and urban policy that's a research center at the Gerald Ford School of public policy at the University of Michigan uh we try to post everything quickly and are in a program to to put our available dat all of our data available and make it available in a userfriendly way for folks to take a look at so closeup one word minus the E yes sir and then my final question is is uh what will you be looking for as far as as we move away from the Paris talks and the agreement to see that it is is or\n\n00:10:26\nisn't working what are the indicators that you'll be looking for well along with this sort of merging consensus of recognition that climate change is a serious issue has been a very broad consensus in the policy science Community economists other Scholars that if we are to deal with this issue we have to impose a price on carbon to drive that price up and deter consumption for which they're pred previous are you talking about cap and trade could be cap and trade could be a carbon do just one way to do it plenty\n\n00:10:54\nof previous Parallels for this we think of tobacco and how we drove down consumption that's a tough time political act because you're basically engaging in a rise at least short term of a commodity that's very familiar we all know the price all the costs are upfront and all the benefits are long-term exactly that's a tough political decision sell it's a tough sell shortterm for long-term benefit will we see States provinces in Canada Nations the world adopt this policy in other words if they've made certain\n\n00:11:22\npledges for numeric pledges about where they're going to be in these numbers by 2022 2028 and Beyond how are they going to get there how transparent are they going to be how effective they will they be and are any policies that they might put into place now or have already begun to create will those be durable will those stand the test of time so far we're learning that governments are all over the place in the ability to make that initial commitment and deliver on it because this is a very volatile area\n\n00:11:51\na lot of strong political reaction so to me that really becomes the asset test it's one thing to put your name on a piece of paper and pledge it's another thing to really deliver over an EXT extended period of time well we'll be watching we know you'll be watching look forward to it thanks Barry always a pleasure John thank you\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "[00:00:00] Let’s be honest: if you’ve been on the internet,\n[00:00:02] you’ve probably seen porn.\n[00:00:03] Whether you went looking for it,\n[00:00:05] a friend shoved a video under your nose,\n[00:00:06] or you got a sketchy DM,\n[00:00:08] it’s hard not to come across porn in our extremely online world.\n[00:00:12] Either way, your first encounter with porn might have piqued your curiosity.\n[00:00:15] Or it might have even disturbed you.\n[00:00:17] It’s okay—we’re gonna unpack all of that together.\n[00:00:20] Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed.\n[00:00:23] [THEME MUSIC]\n[00:00:27] Head’s up: in today’s video, we’ll be talking about a sensitive topic,\n[00:00:31] including sexual assault and descriptions of certain kinds of sex acts.\n[00:00:35] So please keep that in mind and take care when watching.\n[00:00:37] We learn about sex from a lot of different sources.\n[00:00:40] But nobody seems to want to admit that for a lot of people,\n[00:00:43] one of their biggest teachers is pornography:\n[00:00:45] videos, films, magazines, and other forms of media that are meant for sexual arousal.\n[00:00:50] No matter what popped into your head when I first said “porn,”\n[00:00:53] the word has a pretty broad definition,\n[00:00:55] because what’s considered arousing can really vary from person to person.\n[00:00:59] In a Supreme Court case about which sexual material was obscene enough to censor,\n[00:01:03] one of the justices said porn was hard to define,\n[00:01:06] but “I know it when I see it.”\n[00:01:09] Whatever it is, porn is a part of our society.\n[00:01:11] Like, one survey from 2022 found that seventy-three percent of\n[00:01:15] teenagers may have seen porn online,\n[00:01:17] many before the age of thirteen,\n[00:01:19] despite the rise of age-restriction laws that require viewers to be eighteen or older.\n[00:01:24] Teen Shan: Well I definitely don’t watch porn.\n[00:01:26] Shan: Girl, I’m you. I know you’re lying.\n[00:01:29] But I don’t blame you.\n[00:01:30] ‘Cause here’s the thing:\n[00:01:31] The way sex ed classes and the adults in our lives talk about porn\n[00:01:34] — if they do at all —\n[00:01:36] is often full of shame.\n[00:01:37] And that leaves people with a sense that they shouldn’t ask questions.\n[00:01:40] But it turns out, one of the best ways\n[00:01:42] to responsibly engage with porn… is by getting curious.\n[00:01:46] The first thing to know?\n[00:01:47] Images that we might consider pornographic today have been around forever.\n[00:01:50] Peruvian sex pots sculpted fifteen hundred years ago,\n[00:01:53] frescoes from 1st-century Pompeii,\n[00:01:56] 17th-century erotic Japanese paintings.\n[00:01:58] Images of naked people doing sexy stuff have been around for a long time.\n[00:02:02] Although, whether an image was considered\n[00:02:04] pornographic generally depended on the viewer’s cultural background.\n[00:02:07] European archaeologists were often the ones claiming these images were “obscene”\n[00:02:11] without understanding their cultural context.\n[00:02:13] And people haven’t just used explicit material to get all hot and bothered.\n[00:02:17] In 18th-century Europe, they also used it to spread illicit information about\n[00:02:21] contraception and women’s sexual freedom,\n[00:02:23] and to poke fun at the aristocracy.\n[00:02:25] Add this to the fact that porn was seen as depraved,\n[00:02:28] and you can see why its creators were often punished with jail time.\n[00:02:31] But that didn’t stop people from making more.\n[00:02:33] As time went on, and photography and film were invented,\n[00:02:36] visual porn became super popular.\n[00:02:38] And these days, the internet is home to more sexually explicit material than your\n[00:02:42] great-great-great-great-grandparents could have ever imagined.\n[00:02:47] So yes, porn is not new.\n[00:02:49] But what is new is the sheer amount and accessibility of it that we get from the internet.\n[00:02:54] And that comes with some benefits… and some downsides.\n[00:02:57] On the positive side, consuming porn\n[00:02:59] —and even sexy scenes in regular ol’ TV shows and movies—\n[00:03:02] may help destigmatize sex,\n[00:03:04] and provide people with a space to explore their sexuality,\n[00:03:07] especially if information about that kind of thing isn’t available in their IRL communities.\n[00:03:11] This can be particularly true for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n[00:03:16] Remember how the “Q” can stand for “questioning?”\n[00:03:18] Porn can help those folks figure out what they find sexy.\n[00:03:21] In fact, because education about anything but penis-in-vagina sex is hard to come by,\n[00:03:26] young LGBTQ+ people often learn the nuts and bolts of sex from porn.\n[00:03:30] Ultimately, everybody’s relationship with porn is different.\n[00:03:34] But truth be told, porn isn’t all fun and games, either.\n[00:03:37] One of the main reasons? Most of it is not realistic.\n[00:03:40] No matter how amateur the footage looks,\n[00:03:42] the vast majority of video porn is staged for the screen,\n[00:03:45] and the people involved are performers.\n[00:03:47] But that can be hard to remember.\n[00:03:49] If we just accept what happens in those scenes at face value,\n[00:03:52] it can lead to us picking up warped ideas about what sex should look like —\n[00:03:56] or what we should look like.\n[00:03:58] Multiple studies have found that the usually thin, hairless women\n[00:04:01] and chiseled dudes in porn can make young people feel bad about their own bodies,\n[00:04:05] just like airbrushed Instagram models or gym bro TikTokers can.\n[00:04:09] And when it comes to the experience of sex —\n[00:04:11] in pornographic videos, performers often fake orgasms,\n[00:04:15] because again, they’re performing.\n[00:04:18] Teen Shan: WHAT?! They fake orgasms?\n[00:04:20] I mean, I wouldn’t know. I don’t watch porn.\n[00:04:23] Shan: Mmmk. Yeah, Teen Shan.\n[00:04:25] They do fake orgasms.\n[00:04:26] And this can give viewers the false idea that\n[00:04:28] everyone’s going to respond the same way to certain sex acts,\n[00:04:31] and make them wonder if something’s wrong when it doesn’t play out that way.\n[00:04:35] And one of the most unrealistic parts of most\n[00:04:37] porn videos is that they don’t talk about the important stuff.\n[00:04:41] A lot of the time, they’re just naked people on a bed, and they start doing stuff.\n[00:04:45] No consent. No communication about desires.\n[00:04:47] And no protection.\n[00:04:48] People with penises often don’t wear condoms in porn—\n[00:04:51] let alone have a conversation about wearing one.\n[00:04:53] But in reality, talking to each other is one of the key ways to have good sex.\n[00:04:58] Many researchers and educators have also raised red flags about the amount\n[00:05:01] of violence and non-consensual aggression on popular porn sites,\n[00:05:05] especially because they can reflect harmful attitudes about women,\n[00:05:08] and especially women of color.\n[00:05:10] In a 2020 study of over four thousand porn scenes,\n[00:05:13] thirty-five to forty-five percent showed violence,\n[00:05:16] with women being the target ninety-seven percent of the time.\n[00:05:19] Another study showed that Black women were even\n[00:05:22] more likely than white women to be shown as the victims of violence,\n[00:05:25] and Black men were shown as aggressors more often than white men.\n[00:05:28] And the thing about the internet is,\n[00:05:29] you don’t even have to click on these videos\n[00:05:31] to see thumbnails and titles that use racial stereotypes and misogyny.\n[00:05:36] Historically, exploitation of performers has been a major part of the industry, too.\n[00:05:40] This is a complex issue that we won’t dive into today,\n[00:05:43] but know that many people who watch porn are getting more interested in how to do so ethically.\n[00:05:48] Now, as far as the research goes,\n[00:05:51] there’s no conclusive evidence about whether watching violent\n[00:05:53] or misogynistic porn makes someone more likely to act that way offline.\n[00:05:58] Some research, including a survey from 2019, found that respondents who viewed\n[00:06:02] violent porn were more likely to have perpetrated sexual violence,\n[00:06:06] but that doesn’t necessarily mean one causes the other.\n[00:06:09] And emerging research, including one study that surveyed almost\n[00:06:12] five thousand American college students, has found that choking\n[00:06:15] —an act popularized by video porn and other media like “Euphoria”—\n[00:06:19] has increased among young adults,\n[00:06:21] despite the fact that it’s not a safe thing to do, even when it’s consensual.\n[00:06:26] But long-term research is also sparse,\n[00:06:27] and different definitions of porn make it hard to compare findings.\n[00:06:31] And when it comes to misogyny, a lot of studies are at odds.\n[00:06:34] Some say that watching porn is correlated\n[00:06:36] with having sexist attitudes, while some say the opposite.\n[00:06:39] Also, scientists still don’t really know what high exposure to porn does to our brains.\n[00:06:44] If you want to learn more about the research that does exist,\n[00:06:46] you can visit our friends over at SciShow.\n[00:06:49] One way or another, though, porn is still… everywhere.\n[00:06:52] So what do we do with that?\n[00:06:54] The key is to think critically about what we see in porn,\n[00:06:57] and to make smart decisions about it:\n[00:06:59] a little thing called porn literacy.\n[00:07:01] Porn literacy is part of sexual literacy,\n[00:07:04] the critical thinking skills needed to have good sexual health.\n[00:07:07] And it’s not all that different from media literacy.\n[00:07:09] It involves a lot of the same concepts and skills you’d use\n[00:07:12] to identify the biases behind a news article,\n[00:07:15] or figure out if a photo was made by AI.\n[00:07:18] It also involves unpacking the assumptions we adopt from porn so that we don’t\n[00:07:22] spread misinformation or bring harmful behaviors or ideas into our sex lives.\n[00:07:26] Like, if you don’t see people wearing condoms or talking about contraception or STIs in porn,\n[00:07:32] what message is that sending you?\n[00:07:34] So, here are some questions you can ask yourself when\n[00:07:36] you come across a piece of pornographic media:\n[00:07:39] One: How does this make me feel?\n[00:07:42] Two: What is this trying to get me to think about sex or people?\n[00:07:46] Three: What about this might not be true to life?\n[00:07:50] Four: What’s missing from this piece of media?\n[00:07:53] And five: What sources of information can I trust about the stuff I’m seeing here?\n[00:07:58] That last question might be the trickiest —\n[00:08:00] but it’s an important one.\n[00:08:02] We all know we shouldn’t believe everything you see on the internet,\n[00:08:05] but that is where we get a lot of our information.\n[00:08:08] And some online sources are better than others.\n[00:08:10] Some reference research from doctors, sex therapists, and scientific journals.\n[00:08:14] While others… well, you’ve probably seen some of those TikToks.\n[00:08:18] Also, it’s worth noting that these\n[00:08:20] critical-thinking skills don’t just apply to explicit videos.\n[00:08:24] You can use these questions to analyze any information about sex you encounter,\n[00:08:28] from TV and movies to fanfiction and spicy romance novels.\n[00:08:31] Or my personal favorite medium: audio erotica.\n[00:08:35] ‘Cause the thing is: there’s nothing wrong with\n[00:08:38] wanting to explore your sexuality or responsibly seek out pleasure.\n[00:08:41] But like anything else,\n[00:08:43] it’s important to make sure we do so in a way that’s healthy, safe, and mindful.\n[00:08:48] Ultimately, not everybody watches porn on the regular,\n[00:08:50] and it’s certainly not a requirement for a happy sex life.\n[00:08:53] But for those who enjoy it,\n[00:08:55] it’s important to think critically about what’s being portrayed.\n[00:08:57] Because in the end, porn is designed to arouse and entertain.\n[00:09:01] But it’s not meant to educate—for that, you’ve got things like Crash Course.\n[00:09:05] Coming up next, we’re talking all about orgasms.\n[00:09:08] See you then.\n[00:09:08] This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed was produced\n[00:09:11] in partnership with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.\n[00:09:14] If you are interested in learning more,\n[00:09:16] visit their website for resources that explore the topics we discussed in the video today.\n[00:09:21] Thank you for watching this episode,\n[00:09:22] which was filmed at our studio in Indianapolis and\n[00:09:24] was made with the help of all these sexually literate people.\n[00:09:27] If you want to help keep Crash Course free for everyone, forever,\n[00:09:31] you can join the community on
